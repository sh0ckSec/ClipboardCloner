# RFID Gooseneck

This idea was born during the pandemic when our red team had to continue conducting physical pen tests. Traditional RFID badge cloning methods require you to be within 3 feet of your target, so how can you conduct a physical penetration test and clone a badge if you must stay at least 6 feet from a person? Since 2020, companies have increasingly adopted a hybrid work environment, allowing employees to partially work remotely which has decreased the amount of foot traffic in and out of a building at any given time. So after throwing around some ideas I thought, why not create a mobile long-range reader device that we could deploy early in the morning at a client site and let it do all the work for us.  This project guide contains an entry-level hardware design that you can build in a day and deploy in the field in order to increase your chances of remotely cloning an RFID badge.

This is part of a full paper and talk given during **DEFCON 30** in the Physical Bypass Village and Radio Frequency Village titled: **Keeping Your Distance: Pwning RFID Physical Access Controls From 6FT and Beyond** (YouTube Link Coming Soon). Here's the full build guide for making your own RFID Goosneck Long Range Reader!

# Gooseneck Base Installation Guide 
Ok, let's do this. 

### Wooden Base List:
* MDF or Plywood (16"x16"x0.5")
* Non-Slip Furniture Feet: https://a.co/d/8oR8tHj  
* Pedestal Pro 36"H Gooseneck: https://bit.ly/3bCz6go
* 6-32 x 1.25" Carriage Bolts and Wing Nuts and Washers (Quantity of 6 each) 
* Black Spray Paint

### Step 1 - Cut Out Wood Base
* If you have access to a laser cutter or a ShopBot, feel free to download the "GooseneckBaseMK2Template_sh0ck" template file(s) or cut out your own 16"x16" piece of MDF or plywood.

### Step 2 - Align Pedestal
* Center the gooseneck pedestal and place the edge of the base approximately 1.25" away from the edge of the base. The 1.25" (3.175cm) distance from the edge will counter-balance the weight of the long-range reader so it will not tip over when installed. 
* Next trace and drill the 6-32 mounting holes.

### Step 3 - Paint
* Spray the base with a matte black spray paint of your choice.

### Step 4 - Install Feet 
* When the paint is dry, drill the non-slip furniture feet onto the bottom of the base.

### Step 5 - Fasten Pedestal to Base 
Last, fasten the pedastal to the wooden base with bolts and wingnuts. Then place the pedastal cover over top to conceal the screws.

# Long Range Reader Cloning Guide
Let's build the long-range reader cloning device. 
### Long Range Reader Part List: 
* ESP RFID Tool: https://hackerwarehouse.com/product/esp-rfid-tool/
* Low-Frequency Long Range Reader (e.g. HID MaxiProx 5375) OR High-Frequency Long Range Reader (e.g. HID iCLASS SE R90) 
* Breadboard Jumper Wires - 3.9in (10cm): https://a.co/d/fja090p 
* 22AWG Wire: https://a.co/d/h7bbBom 
* 18AWG 12V 5A DC Power Pigtail Barrel Plug Connector Cable: https://a.co/d/7l56UFQ
* 12V 6000mAh/5V 12000mAh DC Battery: https://a.co/d/9czvggQ
* 3M Dual Lock Clear Velcro: https://a.co/d/gg4SzBd

### Wiring Guide 
Below is an example of the wiring guide to connect to a long-range reader with screw-in terminals using the ESP RFID Tool. Use the color coded male-to-male breadboard wires to connect the two terminal interfaces between the Wiegand system and the ESP RFID Tool as seen below.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104524120/183313184-f8f62a73-4bb1-403b-8c65-bfd9d5edac78.PNG" width=80% height=80%>

* Then connect the 12V 5A DC Power Pigtail Barrel Plug Male Connector cable into the Wiegand system (R90 pictured) and trail the cable to the outside of the reader so you can plug it into the 12V 6000mAh DC Battery. 

*Note: For various configurations, check out the official ESP RFID Tool wiring guide here: https://github.com/rfidtool/ESP-RFID-Tool/blob/master/Installation-Schematics/README.md*

# Mounting Reader to Pedestal
Depending on which reader you use you will need to find the correct mounting hole guide for each. You will have to manually drill holes to center it and use the same 6-32 carriage bolts and wingnuts to mount the reader at the top of the gooseneck. Below is an example mount guide for the HID iCLASS R90.

# Cloning Low Frequency Cards - Android Phone + Proxmark3 Easy 
To remain incognito while at the client site, cloning a card via an Android phone will keep the lowest profile rather than fidling with a laptop when you need to copy the card data. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104524120/183313587-635d6993-c76d-49c7-9b92-a2122933511a.PNG" width=40% height=40%>

### Mobile Cloning Gear:
* Android Phone or Tablet of your choice
* AndProx Android App: https://github.com/AndProx/AndProx  
* Proxmark3 Easy (available on eBay or AliExpress)
* USB OTG Cable - Type C To Micro: https://a.co/d/4HGdBqh
* RFID T5577 Rewritable Cards: https://a.co/d/0NF2zJG
* 3D Printed Case (optional): https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3123482 

### Step 1A  - Access RFID Loot
Once the implant is in place and a few employees have walked past the gooseneck reader, hop onto your phone and log into your the RFID ESP Key SSID to look for loot. The default SSID is "ESP-RFID-Tool" but it is recommended to change the name to something that will blend into the target environment.
* Default SSID: **ESP-RFID-Tool**
* URL: http://192.168.1.1
* Default Username: *admin*
* Default Password: *rfidtool*
